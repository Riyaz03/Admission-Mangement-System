Introduction: 
    We developed a web application in 2nd Year 2nd Semester of our B.Tech as a
part of Enterprise Programming Course's Project. We are pursuing our B.Tech in 
KL Deemed To Be University(University Webiste) in the discipline of Computer 
Science And Engineering. Students get more confused while deciding the 
institution in which they have to take admission to make these things easy we 
took Admission Management System as our project's concept. Through this website 
students can themselves explore about the institutions and their records or 
achievements in the last year.


Objective: 
    We named our website as 'CollegeSketch', Admission Management System is our 
project's topic or business system. We developed a website through which 
student can explore different colleges, universities or internships details. 
User can see all the primary information about the Institution in which he want 
to take the admission.

Modules:
    We divided our project into three modules. 
    They are: User Module, Admin Module and Filters Module

User Module:
   This module includes all the features or website that a user can access.
After creating a account and logging in to our website user can explore
internships, colleges, universities that are available in our database. All the
fields in login and signup page have validations which are added using 
JavaScript. Website has a common login page for both admin and user, based on
the mail id entered they will be taken to either admin home page or user home 
page.
Admin Module: 
    This module includes all the features or web pages that a admin can access.
Admin can perform all the Insert, Update, Delete, View operations on every table
present in our database(Example: Admin can view all the data of users except
password, he can insert all institutions data through our website without using
the command line or GUI provided by Oracle). Admin can't create a account
through signup page, his data need to be inserted into database by the 
developer. Once it is done admin can login through the login page.
Filters Module: 
    This module includes the filters that we provided in the navigation bar of our 
website. Example : User can filter colleges by selecting the
branch(MPC, Bipc, â€¦) and User can filter universities by entering the 
Eamcet Rank or Jee Mains Percentage he achieved in his intermediate graduation 
and students who are pursuing B.Tech can filter the internships based on their
specialization(CSE,ECE,EEE....)
